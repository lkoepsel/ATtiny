## [env_make.md](env_make.md)
The file env_make is used to customize the *make* process for *ATtiny13A* development. It is **required** in order for make to properly identify the parameters needed for compiling/linking/uploading executable code to an AVR microcontroller. **This file is not tracked by *git* and needs to be installed manually.** 

## [vs_code.md](vs_code.md)
This page contains the files needed to be more efficient with *VS Code*. Install them in the *.vscode* folder of *AVR_C*. They are not tracked by *git*.

## [git.md](git.md)
Notes on using *git*. I am neither an expert on *git* nor proficient in *git*. This page is primarily for myself, however, it has helped a few people.

## RPI_build.md - see this page in the AVR_C repository
If you want to use a Raspberry Pi (3/4/5) as a C development platform, this page is for you! Highly detailed, it will show every step required to build the latest software for developing C on an AVR microcontroller. Have fun!
